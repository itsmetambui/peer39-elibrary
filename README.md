## Getting Started

Clone the repo locally, and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Improvements and considerations
The following are the further improvements suggested as they are outside of the project scope requirements, and consideration for alternative technical choices.

- Zod is used instead of Yup for simple copy/paste sake since other dependencies in this project is using Zod. A switch would be easily achievable if needed.
- For this kind of CMS type of application, a `SSR/SSG` solution would be better. But since thereâ€™s no Backend, `CSR` is the only choice.
- Pagination is currently performed only on the Frontend after loading all the records from the mock BE, it should be done in the Backend.
- Pagination should be synced to url (i.e `?pageSize=5&page=2`).
- The author pickers and autocomplete could be improved with [infinite queries](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/infinite-queries) and [virtualization](https://tanstack.com/virtual/latest) in case the author list becomes too long.
- Use `slug` for url params instead of `id`.
